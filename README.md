# LibraryProgressBar
ProgressBar library is a short example that helps the developer understand the use of arcs used in drawing views with different paints. Also included are are examples to animate a view or draw line with animation i.e invalidating a view. Will add more later. Hope it helps.<br><br>
The below gif shows the different views created:<br>
1) Animating an arc using invalidate. [Refer ProgressView.java]<br>
2) Displaying multiple arc's in the same 'RectF' based on their angles. [Refer MultipleProgressView.java]<br>
3) Rotating an arc along the angle specified, in clockwise / anticlockwise. [Refer RotatingProgressView.java]<br>
4) Drawing a line (actually a Rect to havae control on height), with invalidating view. [Refer LineProgress.java]<br>
5) Drawing a semicircle with different multiple arc with different Paints.
